#Procedural Map Generator#

A Javascript program that procedurally generates maps based on elevation, temperature and preciptation.  The user can dynamically adjust temperature, precipitation and ocean level in a control panel to tweak the map to suit their preferences.  Biomes are assigned to individual tiles dependant upon the localized attributes of the tile.
